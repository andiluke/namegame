Name Game

This is my basic MEAN learning project.

running
* install global installs (below)
* run mondod in a tab

global installs
* mongodb (database)
* nodemon (watches server/app file changes & restarts server as needed)

ToDos:
* customize frontend
* show something on save
* bug: saving a middle name when none exist fails
* clear field after middle name added
* add/edit ratings
* add names
* use node-curl to scrape name details from somewhere
* switch to mlab instead of local db
* switch to cloud hosted rather than local
* figure out express routing better, like send all the angualr urls to angular instead of dealing with each individually
* style??
